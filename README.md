# Real-Time-Inflation-DashBoard

This project compares the real-time inflation index to the RBI-issued inflation index using Data from Amazon Big Basket.

We checked the price history from time to time. using the account of the specific item price.

We made it in the format of an interactive dashboard using PowerBI.

For further improvement, we tried the country's economy based on the particular value of the CPI index.

Below are some attached ScreenShots to show the dashboard

## Methodology

Web Scrapping from Amazon and Big Basket performed data cleaning using selenium.

We are forming the table in a CSV format and loading it into a dashboard format using powerBI.

Showed the visualization in the format of the line chart, bar chart, column chart, and scatter plots

## Analysis of Results

Taking 2012 as the base year and then performing the inflation, I got a 5% fluctuation from the released initial RBI inflation index.

The fluctuation is caused mainly by considering many parameters, but RBI doesn't take them all, so this fluctuation is observed.

In 2019, we saw a significant difference between the calculated and original indexes due to government intervention and many policy changes that happened that year.
